**Using experimental and computational approaches, I'm focusing on the interconnections between neuronal, glial and vascular cells during health and neurological disorders.**

The neuronal network is a highly organized dynamic system that requires a cell type-specific recognition code that identifies the right connections and alters them through experience. 
In the laboratory, we seek to understand how cell to cell communications are regulated by cell type-specific adhesion molecules during both health and disease. The importance of cell adhesions in brain function is highlighted by the fact that mutations in cell adhesion genes are associated with vascular, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

Using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, live imaging and molecular approaches we seek to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the interconnection between neuronal, glial and vascular cells.
