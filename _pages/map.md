For my Masters' first year internship I studied the impact of DNA supercoiling
			on the gene expression and thus acting as a regulation factor. We investigated
			the statistical link between DNA supercoiling and the AT-content of bacterial
			promoters. We found that supercoiling sensitive genes that are induced by
			DNA relaxation had a higher AT-content than those repressed by relaxation.
			We also defined an interval of 6nt on which no contact with a regulation
			or transcription protein is known. The AT-content on this interval may act
			as a discriminant factor into the differential reponse in front of supercoiling
			regulation.
