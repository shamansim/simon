# Summary


After starting medicine school, I discovered bioinformatics and changed for a B.Sc. in Biology with a 
specialization in Biostatistics, Modelling and Bioinformatics. I continued in the
same direction with the M.Sc. and performed my Masters' internship
at the RIKEN in Japan where I developped analyses for Single-Cell RNA-Seq data.
I further came to Munich as a PhD Student in
the Systems Neuroscience Group of the Institute for Stroke and
Dementia Research (ISD) where I extend my knowledge of
the data analysis **in silico** to the biological experimental design
and the sample preparation **in vitro** and **in vivo** in the context
of neurological disorders.
