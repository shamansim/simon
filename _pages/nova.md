At Novadiscovery, a start-up/company specialized in *in silico* drug-efficiency models,
one of their main challenge approaching pharmaceutical companies is to convince them of the power
of *in silico* for such sensitive tasks as clinical trials. I was therefore in charge of gathering
from the last 20 years literature, proofs of concepts of *in silico* helping and accelerating the
development of drug design and development.
